# Data Structures and Algorithms
In order to get a deep understanding of the most fundamental DS&amp;As, I implemented them in C++. 
This repository contains the following work (i|r = iterative and recursive):

- Linked List:
  * Find node by index
  * Insert node at index
  * Remove node at index
  * Print/Reverse print (i|r)
  * Reverse linked list (i|r and using a stack)

- Doubly Linked List:
  * Insert node (head and tail)
  * Print
  * Reverse print (i|r)

- Binary Search Tree:
  * Insert node (i|r)
  * Search for value
  * Delete node
  * Find minimum node
  * Get inorder successor
  * Get lowest value (i|r)
  * Get highest value (i|r)
  * Find height of tree
  * Breadth first traversal
  * Depth first traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder)
  * Check if tree is BST (iterative and two recursive methods)

- Graphs:
  * Adjacency list implementation
  * Adding nodes to list
  * Breadth First Search (BFS)
  * Depth First Search (DFS)

- Heap:
  * Working array heap including heapify down and up
  * Rescaling array 

- Stack/Queue:
  * Working implementation of array and linked list variant

- Hashtable:
  * Create a hash and use it to store values in a hashtable
